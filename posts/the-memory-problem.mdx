While the industry is currently obsessing over reasoning capabilities and inference speed (looking at you, o1), I’m with [Dharmesh Shah](https://x.com/dharmesh/status/1983201423048487018) on this one. The reasoning layer is getting better, but AI memory is what is **REALLY** being slept on.

The way I see it, we aren't dealing with a capacity problem anymore; we are dealing with an architecture problem.

Right now, most production-grade LLM applications are cobbling together three distinct memory "modules." They function, but they act like three different departments in a corporation that refuse to talk to each other.

Here is the current stack:

## 1. Short Term Memory (The Context Window)

This is the sliding window of immediate tokens––the "working memory." It’s high fidelity but extremely expensive (computationally and financially) to maximize. You shove the last `n` messages into the prompt, and the model "remembers."

## 2. Long Term Memory (RAG)

Retrieval Augmented Generation. This is the industry standard for "knowledge." You vectorise documents or past chats, stick them in a database (like Pinecone or Weaviate), and perform a semantic search based on the user's query.

It’s great for facts, but terrible for nuance. It retrieves isolated chunks of text without knowing *when* they happened or *why* they mattered.

## 3. "Broad Term" Memory (Summarization)

This is the elusive middle layer. I’ve seen this attempted in tools like Cursor or GitHub Copilot. The idea is to compress past context into a summary and keep that persistent in the system prompt.

My hot take? I haven't really noticed much of a difference in daily use. The compression is often too lossy––it strips away the very details that make the context useful.

## The Silo Problem

The issue isn't that these technologies are bad; it's that they are distinct.

We treat RAG as a search engine and the Context Window as a buffer. But that isn't how memory works––at least, not effective memory.

If I am building a journaling tool like Echo (think AI-powered reflection, not just auto-complete), I need the model to understand the *arc* of the user's life, not just keyword matches.

If a user talks about "anxiety," a standard RAG system might pull up a journal entry from three years ago. But without **temporal context**, the AI doesn't know if that anxiety was resolved, if it worsened, or if it’s a recurring seasonal pattern.

The chunks are retrieved, but the *story* is lost.

## The "Orchestration" Hypothesis

I think there is a lot of untapped ROI in using these modules to feed each other, rather than running them in parallel.

Here is where the bridge starts to form:

### 1. Broad Term steering Long Term

We should use the high-level summary (Broad Term) to refine the RAG query. If the summary knows the user is currently in a "career transition phase," the RAG retrieval should weigh career-related documents higher than relationship documents––even if the keywords are ambiguous.

### 2. Sequential Broad Term Memory

This is the concept I’m most interested in. Instead of one big "summary blob," we need a linked list of chronological summaries. This captures the *sequence* of events without blowing up the token count.

It allows the AI to see the "shape" of the timeline. It provides the breadcrumbs required to know *where* to look in the Long Term storage.

## The End State

If we get this orchestration right, we move beyond simple "Chat with your Data." We get a system that possesses:

* The **Breadth** of a lifetime (via Sequential Summaries).
* The **Focus** of a moment (via the Context Window).
* The **Precision** of a surgeon (via targeted RAG).

I’m going to continue experimenting with this architecture in Echo to see if we can engineer memory that feels less like a database query and more like intuition.

It’s an implementation-adjacent challenge, but I suspect it’s the key to the next jump in perceived intelligence.
