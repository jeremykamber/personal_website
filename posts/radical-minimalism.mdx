Minimalism isn't just about using less ink. It's about respecting the user's attention.

In my recent redesign of this portfolio, I adhered to a strict set of rules:
1.  **Black and White only**. No branding colors to distract from the content.
2.  **Typography as UI**. The font weight and size dictate hierarchy, not colored badges or boxes.
3.  **Standardized Components**. Using `shadcn/ui` ensures consistency and accessibility out of the box.

The result is a site that loads instantly and communicates clearly.
