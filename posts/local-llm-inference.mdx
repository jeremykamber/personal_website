The capabilities of open-source models (like Llama 3 and Mistral) are converging with proprietary models at an astonishing rate.

Combined with Apple's M-series chips and optimized inference engines like `llama.cpp` and `Ollama`, we are entering an era where **local inference** is not just viable, but preferable for many use cases.

## Why Local?

1.  **Privacy**: Data never leaves your machine.
2.  **Latency**: No network roundtrips.
3.  **Cost**: Zero API fees.

I recently built [Echo](/portfolio), a journaling app that runs strictly locally using embedded vectors and RAG. The experience is instant and completely private.
