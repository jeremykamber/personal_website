At **Bringforth Studio**, we faced a common problem: heavily manual SDR work.

## The Solution

We built an autonomous agent pipeline that:
*   Scrapes leads from defined ICP sources.
*   Enriches data using external APIs.
*   Drafts personalized emails based on recent news about the prospect.

The key was **structured prompting**. Instead of asking the LLM to "write a cold email", we provided it with the exact value proposition, the prospect's pain points (inferred), and a strict tone guide (no fluff).

This reduced our prospecting time by ~75% and increased reply rates by 2.5x compared to generic templates.
